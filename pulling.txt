// There should be lines here. I've sucessfully merged main and SPC branches.

1. When pulling make sure vscode has a new folder selected
2. Open terminal and type in:

git init
git remote add origin [URL]
git pull origin [branch name]

3. When updating a branch from github:

git pull origin [branch name you want to fetch and merge with]

OR

// Manually fetch and merge
git branch [name of merging branch]
git checkout [name of merging branch]
git fetch [name of branch on github repo]
git checkout [main branch or any branch you want to merge into]
git merge [name of merging branch]

// I will now attempt to fetch and merge files and these lines will prove me that I can do it.
